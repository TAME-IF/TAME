		<strong>TAME</strong> (<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>A</strong>dventure <strong>M</strong>odule <strong>E</strong>ngine) is an <em>Interactive Fiction Engine</em> that
		assists in the creation of Interactive Fiction. What sets TAME apart from most authoring tools is that it is not so much an all-in-one-authoring package 
		with audio-visual hooks, but rather a single piece of logic that maintains a game state and interprets player input.
	</p>
	<p>
		TAME's main programs are called <em>Modules</em>. Modules hold the entirety of a game's world: its <strong>Actions</strong>,
		<strong>Objects</strong>, <strong>Rooms</strong>, <strong>Player</strong> Viewpoints, abstract <strong>Containers</strong>,
		and the <strong>World</strong> itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		TAME Modules are written in a language called <em>TAMEScript</em>.

		<strong>TAMEScript</strong> is what every TAME Module is written in. Through TAMEScript, you can define every part of
		your <strong>world</strong> - the <strong>players</strong> inside it, what <strong>rooms</strong> the players can visit, 
		the <strong>objects</strong> in the world, and what happens when you interact with them via <strong>actions</strong>. 
		In essence, you are creating the rules and the environment in which your piece of Interactive Fiction takes place.
	</p>
	<p>
		A TAMEScript module can be as small as:

<div class="w3-container">
<!--[ tamescript "Hello World" module_intro_helloworld helloworld.tame ]-->
</div>
<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		Or it can contain a plethora of things!
	</p>

<div class="w3-container">
<!--[ tamescript "A Small Adventure" module_intro_adventure_small adventure-small.tame ]-->

<div class="w3-container">
	<p>
		A TAME Module's code runs in a thing called a <strong>Virtual Machine</strong>. It is the thing that figures out a player's <strong>input</strong>,
		translates it into an <strong>action</strong>, finds a relevant <strong>entry point</strong> into the module, and executes the code.
		Simply put, the <strong>Virtual Machine</strong> is just another word for the brains that make TAME work. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A TAME Module itself is <em>immutable</em>, which means once it is defined, it cannot be changed. You cannot add code to a module
		as it runs, and you can't add new rooms or objects or containers or players during its execution.
	</p>
	<p>
		"But," you say, "doesn't the world change with my actions?" Of course! When you run a TAME Module, the module gets loaded into memory,
		and that doesn't change. What DOES change, however, is chunk of data created from the module, called a <strong>Context</strong>.
