==============================================================================

0.9BETA9
........

	- Fixed Open Actions causing TypeErrors in the JS implementation.
	
	- TAMEC can take an arbitrary starting file for the JS compiler, expanding
	  the options for how to bundle a compiled module, but only if you
	  know the directives, which are not documented yet (but you can
	  find them in the source code!).
	  
	- Added queue keyword and removed QUEUEACTION*() functions. Queueing
	  commands now works like this:
	  queue a_generalaction;
	  queue a_modalaction, "mode";
	  queue a_openaction, "opentarget";
	  queue a_transitiveaction, o_object;
	  queue a_transitiveaction : c_container;
	  queue a_transitiveaction : c_container, "tagname";
	  queue a_ditransitiveaction, o_object;
	  queue a_ditransitiveaction : c_container;
	  queue a_ditransitiveaction : c_container, "tagname";
	  queue a_ditransitiveaction, o_object, o_object2;
